 List Pagination and Filtering


This project paginates a given list of students and creates links which dynamically display a set of students. As is, a page link is created for every 10 students.

Vanilla javascript. List items are displayed or hidden using the "display" style property. Html elements are dynamically created and appended to the DOM. An event handler displays the desired page of students upon clicking a link element.
